A linked list is a collection of entities which are not stored in sequential order. Instead, each entity
has a pointer to the next entity. Each entity, also referred to as a node, is composed of data and a
reference (in other words, a link) to the next node in the sequence.

The main operations on linked lists are:
• prepend - add a node to the beginning of the list
• append - add a node to the end of the list
• delete - remove a node from the list
• deleteTail - remove the last node from the list
• deleteHead - remove the first node from the list
• find - find a node in the list
